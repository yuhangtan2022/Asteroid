# Asteroid

## Introduction

An attempt at recreating the infamous 'Asteroids' game. 

# How to play

You control a spaceship in outerspace and the objective is to see how long you can last without being hit by an asteroid. Your ship will be firing bullets at a constant rate while you adjust the direction and thrust of the ship. What makes this game difficult is: First, the asteroids will split in half into smaller portions making more of them, and harder to hit; second, we know that in the vacuum of space, there is no friction, so precise maneuver of the ship while carrying the momentum to your advantage is the key to stall for a long period of time wihtout getting hit.
